# AI Philosophy

We only have access to GitHub Copilot at work, but I've been experimenting with
Claude Code heavily on toy projects. For this type of greenfield task I feel
like primarily driving things with Claude Code is the best and the modern way to
go.

However I will iterate with AI in the `dev` branch before every PR
into `main` I will clean everything up and make sure I 100%
understand the code an am happy with it, for each PR.

# Planning

I created README.md and wrote my version of the spec/requirements. I used
ChatGPT to discuss which libraries to use and what the general UI should look
like. I added all decisions to the README.
