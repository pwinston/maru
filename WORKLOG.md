# AI Usage

I used ChatGPT during the planning phase and Claude Code during development.

While I only have access to GitHub Copilot at work, I've been experimenting with
Claude Code on several side-projects. I'm convinced enough it or something like
it is the future, so I decided to use it heavily for this assignment.

However I'm going to develop with two branches `dev` and `main`. I will at times
check in "raw" AI code into `dev`, but I will only create a PR from `dev` to
`main` if I've manually examined all the code and refactored/improved/commented
it to be production quality.

# Planning

I created README.md and wrote my version of the spec/requirements. I used
ChatGPT to discuss which libraries to use and what the general UI should look
like. I added all decisions to the README.
