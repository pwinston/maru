# AI Usage

I used ChatGPT during the planning phase and Claude Code during development.

While I only have access to GitHub Copilot at work, I've been experimenting a
lot with Claude Code on side-projects. I believe that style of development is
the future, at least for greenfield code. So I decided to use it heavily for
this assignment. I've a flow like this:

1. Use Claude Code to generate the next step quickly
2. Examine the code closely and refactor by hand or with Claude Code

For this project I'm using branches like this:

1. `dev` is rapid iteration with Claude Code
2. PRs into `main` only when well-understood and cleaned up

# Planning

I created README.md and wrote my version of the spec/requirements. I used
ChatGPT to discuss which libraries to use and what the general UI should look
like. I added all decisions to the README.

# Development
